# ðŸŒ™ BEDTIME CONTINUITY PROTOCOL

## Trigger Phrase: "it's bedtime!"

When you say **"it's bedtime!"**, I will automatically generate a comprehensive handoff prompt for the next session.

## What Gets Captured:

### 1. **Project Status Snapshot**
- Current phase and percentage completion
- Last completed tasks
- Current work in progress
- Next immediate priorities

### 2. **Technical Context**
- Recent code changes and their locations
- Any configuration updates
- Current testing setup (tunnel URLs, server status)
- Known issues or blockers

### 3. **Session-Specific Learnings**
- What worked well
- What didn't work
- Key technical insights discovered
- Important debugging solutions

### 4. **Perfect Handoff Prompt Template**

```
Continue working on the Cloddo project (Claude Desktop Alternative). 

**Project Status:** [Current phase] - [X%] complete
**Last Session Work:** [Summary of what was accomplished]
**Current State:** [What's currently running/configured]
**Immediate Next Steps:** [1-3 specific tasks to tackle first]

**Technical Context:**
- Architecture: [Brief architecture summary]
- Recent Changes: [Key files/components modified]
- Testing Setup: [How to test current work]
- Dependencies: [Any important dependency information]

**Key Learnings from Last Session:**
[Important technical insights, solutions, or patterns discovered]

**Continuation Instructions:**
1. Read PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md and AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md first
2. Review current progress in TodoWrite
3. [Specific next actions]

**Files to check first:** [List of key files to examine]
**Testing URL:** [Current tunnel URL or testing method]

Please continue from exactly where we left off, maintaining the same technical approach and quality standards.
